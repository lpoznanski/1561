# OpenAPI samples

These files present sample APIs in JSON format (YAML is also available in *yaml* directory) that use a pet store as an example to demonstrate features in the OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 specification. 
These files' original source is available at OpenAPI-Specification Repository: https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/examples/.

# OpenAPI support in Oxygen

- OpenAPI documents can be edited in the Oxygen Text mode, but a built-in framework also renders OpenAPI (Swagger) documents in the **Author visual editing mode**. When opening a detected OpenAPI document in Author mode, you have access to some form controls, collapsible sections, and other features that help you to visualize and edit these documents.

- Oxygen includes a GUI interface testing tool for OpenAPI files, called **OpenAPI Tester**. The tool provides the ability to execute API requests and validate responses on the fly to ensure that they work as expected. 

- There is also an **OpenAPI Documentation generator** tool that helps you to easily generate full documentation for OpenAPI components in HTML format, including comprehensive annotations and cross references. The documentation displays information about the servers, paths, components and tags defined in the OpenAPI documents. It also includes the JSON schema documentation for the components along with the diagram image for each component generated according to specified options.
