# JSON samples

These files are an illustration of custom JSON frameworks, designed for Author rendering. There is a sample application form (*residentCardForm.json*) and a sample travel guide (*travel-guide.json*), along with referenced resources in the *images* folder.

# JSON in Author

- You can edit JSON files in the visual Author editing mode and you have access to the various features and actions that are available when editing XML documents in this visual mode. When a JSON document is opened in Author mode, it is automatically converted to proper XML structure using the built-in JSON to XML Converter. 

- You can also create your own custom JSON framework, similar to the process for creating custom XML frameworks. Find more details in the userguide: https://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/ug-editor/topics/json-editor.html#json-editor__section_vbc_lfw_thb.
