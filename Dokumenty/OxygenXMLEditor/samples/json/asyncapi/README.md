# AsyncAPI samples

These files present a streaming API in JSON format (YAML is also available in *yaml* directory) for the message and networking platform Gitter, showcasing some features of the AsyncAPI 1.x and 2.x specification. These files' original source is available at [AsyncAPI Initiative Repository](https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/blob/v2.4.0/examples/gitter-streaming.yml).

# AsyncAPI support in Oxygen

- Oxygen includes a **specialized framework** for working with AsyncAPI files for versions: 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.2.0, 2.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.2.0, 2.3.0, 2.4.0. You can edit AsyncAPI files in Text mode and you have access to all the usual text editing actions and you can also edit them in the **visual Author editing mode** and you have access to the various features and actions that are available when editing XML documents in Author mode.

- Oxygen helps you edit AsyncAPI files through the **Content Completion Assistant**, offering proposals for properties and values that can be inserted at the cursor position. There are also some default **AsyncAPI templates** available when creating new documents from templates.

- Oxygen includes **built-in validation** for AsyncAPI documents to help you keep them well-formed. The documents are validated automatically as you type against the schema specified in the framework and problems are highlighted within the document.
