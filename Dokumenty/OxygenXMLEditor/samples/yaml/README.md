# YAML samples

These samples highlight the syntax of YAML documents, used in documenting APIs and configuration files. They are similar to the sample files provided in *json* directory.

# YAML support in Oxygen

Oxygen provides a strong support for working with YAML documents, such as:

- a specialized YAML editor with various editing features, syntax highlighting and Outline view. There is also a document template to help you get started with YAML documents. 

- built-in validation engine for YAML documents to help you keep them well-formed. YAML documents are validated automatically as you type and the validation engine detects 
syntax errors (such as improper indentation or duplicate keys), based on the YAML specification. The built-in validation also works on files that consist of multiple YAML documents.
You can validate YAML documents using a JSON Schema file that can be associated directly in the document, or through a Validation scenario.

- an intelligent Content Completion Assistant that offers proposals for inserting YAML structures that are valid at the current editing location.
